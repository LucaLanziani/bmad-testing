# Todo Management Web Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable users to easily create, view, and manage their todo items in a single, accessible location
- Provide clear visibility of upcoming deadlines to reduce the risk of missed commitments
- Deliver an engaging, colorful user experience that makes task management feel less burdensome
- Support offline-capable, local browser usage without requiring backend infrastructure

### Background Context

Many individuals struggle with keeping track of their personal tasks and deadlines across multiple contexts. Traditional todo management solutions often require account creation, internet connectivity, or complex setups that create friction. This project aims to deliver a lightweight, browser-based todo application that runs entirely locally, eliminating setup barriers while providing an intuitive, visually appealing interface. The colorful design approach recognizes that task management tools don't need to be dull - a pleasant interface can encourage consistent usage and reduce the psychological burden of managing obligations.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The todo application should feel lightweight, fast, and joyful to use. The interface prioritizes clarity and quick task entry over complex features. Users should be able to add a todo and set its deadline in seconds, with minimal clicks. The colorful design creates positive emotional associations with task management, transforming what is often seen as a chore into a more pleasant experience.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Quick Add**: Prominent input field for rapid todo entry, always visible
- **Inline Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for todos without modal dialogs
- **Visual Deadline Indicators**: Color-coded or iconographic indicators for deadline proximity (e.g., green for future, yellow for soon, red for overdue)
- **Single-Click Actions**: Mark complete, delete, edit with minimal interaction
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Support for power users (Enter to add, arrow keys to navigate, Space to mark complete)

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Main Todo List View**: Primary screen showing all todos with deadline visibility
2. **Add/Edit Todo Form**: Simple form for creating or modifying todo items
3. **Filter/Sort Controls**: UI elements for organizing the todo list

### Accessibility: None

For MVP, advanced accessibility features are deferred to post-launch. Basic keyboard navigation will be supported.

### Branding

Clean, modern design with a vibrant color palette. No specific brand guidelines - aim for a friendly, energetic aesthetic that differentiates from typical productivity tools' muted colors.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with responsive design that adapts to browser window size.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing the complete application, as there's only one component (the frontend web app).

### Service Architecture

**Monolith - Static Web Application**: The application is a single-page application (SPA) with no backend services. All logic runs client-side in the browser, with local storage for persistence. This eliminates infrastructure costs and complexity while meeting the offline-first requirement.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**: Unit tests for core todo management logic (CRUD operations, filtering, sorting). Integration tests for local storage persistence. Manual testing for UI/UX validation. No end-to-end testing infrastructure needed for MVP given the simple, self-contained nature of the application.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework**: Modern JavaScript framework recommended (React, Vue, or Svelte) for component-based architecture and efficient rendering
- **Build Tool**: Vite or similar modern build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **CSS Approach**: CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for component-scoped styling, supporting the colorful UI requirement
- **Local Storage**: Browser's localStorage API for data persistence (no backend database)
- **Date Handling**: Use a lightweight date library (e.g., date-fns) for deadline calculations and formatting
- **No Authentication**: Single-user, local-only application requires no login or user management
- **Browser Storage Limits**: Assume 5-10MB localStorage limit per domain (sufficient for 500+ todos)

6. Console warning displays if localStorage is unavailable

## Epic 2: Deadline Management & Visual Indicators

**Epic Goal**: Implement comprehensive deadline functionality that addresses the core problem of tracking todos and their due dates.
